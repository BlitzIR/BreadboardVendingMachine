#What is SR Latch?
SR Latch
Set-Reset Latch (SR Latch) is a device that uses the binary system where 0 is false and 1 is true. It uses digits S and R to indicate inputs, and the output is represented by Q. S or R can either be 0 or 1, S and R are not constrained to a single digit. With Q as the output, it works as an indicator that remembers things.
